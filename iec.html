    <H3>Industry, Economy, and Convservation</H3>
	<p>Under the Cape York Peninsula Tenure Resolution 
	Programme, ownership and management of land is 
	returned to “Aboriginal freehold land”. This outlines 
	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders rights to live on 
	and pursue employment and business opportunities 
	in land management, as well as convert national parks 
	to be jointly managed by Government and Traditional 
	Owners</p>
	
	<div>
	<H4>Land Management and Coservation Economy</H4>
	<p>Indigenous ranger programmes are mostly run by 
	Indigenous tribal corporations that are land-holding 
	entities on Cape York. The term “Ranger” is commonly 
	used in replacement of “conservation worker”. The 
	programmes provide employment, training and career 
	pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and 
	connect environmental and conservation outcomes 
	with preserving and rebuilding culture back to Country. 
	“Ranger bases” facilitate on ground conservation 
	and cultural activity. These can also be considered 
	a homeland or outstation as they perform many of 
	the same functions and experience all of the same 
	challenges. However, there are more opportunities 
	to source funding and support for ranger bases due 
	to the stronger livelihoods contexts and tangible 
	environmental outcomes.
	There are currently 21 Commonwealth Funded 
	Indigenous Ranger Groups in the Cape York Peninsula 
	region, 3 Indigenous Protected Areas, 18 jointly 
	managed National Parks and a large number of 
	Indigenous managed nature refuges (land which is not 
	a national park but treated as one)</div>

	<H4>Fire Management and Carbon Farming</H4>
	<p>Wildfires are generally considered to be a 
	contemporary feature of the landscape of Cape 
	York. Traditional Owners, alongside much scientific 
	research, have identified traditional fire management 
	practices to be an integral component to maintaining 
	biodiversity and ecosystem health, and reducing 
	carbon emissions. 
	Traditional fire management applies cool and quick 
	burns early in the dry season when vegetation begins 
	to dry and the risk of bushfires are low. They avoid the 
	need for chemical weed killers, save flora and fauna 
	from more intensive fires later in the year and are self extinguishing. 
	Cultural burns are also used to protect 
	sites and clear access for cultural purposes, such as 
	hunting and ceremonial grounds. 
	Cool burns release significantly less carbon into the 
	atmosphere than if the area was unmanaged and 
	experienced larger fires in the dry season. The carbon 
	differences between unmanaged land and traditionally 
	managed land can be calculated through satellite 
	monitoring and sold as “carbon credits’’ to generate 
	income for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	organisations. Carbon credits are issued to and traded 
	by Indigenous corporations who are registered in 
	carbon markets.</div>

	<H4>Agriculture and Cattle Farming</H4>
	<p>Pastoralism is the biggest land use, for livestock such 
	as beef cattle and sheep, and is the main source 
	of subsistence farming in Cape York. Today cattle 
	station leases occupy more than half (57%) of the total 
	area of the Cape York Peninsula. However, it is often 
	not a viable income stream on its own and is often 
	combined with conservation or tourism.
	The soil in the Cape York region is old, unproductive 
	and nutrient poor compared to the rest of Australia. 
	Decades of cattle farming and overgrazing has 
	contributed to land degradation and disrupted natural 
	ecosystems. Rapid urban expansion and mining 
	activities compete for prime agricultural land that can 
	affect ecosystem services vital for sustainable soil 
	management and health.
	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities do 
	not yet conduct any large scale agricultural practices. 
	Any crops grown by cattle stations are primarily to 
	support feeding the cattle for pastoral farming. In 
	the Hope Vale area, small communities are trialing 
	banana and other plantations. 
	The Australian native food industry is rapidly 
	growing. The Australian Native and Food Botanical
	is responsible for overseeing the sustainable 
	development of the native food industry while 
	representing the interests of traditional and new native 
	products. </div>
	
	<div>
	<H4>Fishing</H4>
	<p>Subsistence fishing and hunting is still practiced 
	and enjoyed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	communities. These include prawning, skilled 
	spearfishing in shallow water, spear and line catch in 
	small boats or by casting nets. Crayfish diving is also 
	popular and can be highly valuable at markets. 
	Traditional hunting for turtles and dugong is a 
	significant cultural practice across Cape York. Local 
	clan groups work to control and manage this practice, 
	to protect turtle and dugong populations, in the 
	face of modern hunting methods, plastic debris and 
	climate change impacts on habitats.
	Commercial fishing along the coast is very limited, 
	particularly along the Great Barrier Reef as it is a 
	protected World Heritage site. There are few cases of 
	Indigenous commercial fishing along the Cape York 
	coastline, however interest is growing. </div>
	
	<div>
	<H4>Mining</H4>
	<p>Rich bauxite (the ore from which aluminium and 
	tungsten is made) deposits are found and mined 
	across the northwestern coast of Cape York Peninsula 
	that provide an estimated 53% of Australia’s bauxite. 
	The mining town of Weipa on the west coast is the 
	largest town on the Cape York Peninsula.
	Traditional Owners can benefit from mining through 
	a variety of channels such as royalties in trust 
	funds, direct payments, stakes in ownership and 
	employment and training. However, the history of 
	mining and meaningful benefits for Indigenous 
	peoples in Cape York can be complex and can be 
	the cause of much conflict. Some Aboriginal and 
	Torres Strait Islander people and land holding groups 
	support mining on Cape York, but many do not. </div>
	
	<div>
	<H4>Tourism</H4>
	<p>There is a developing tourism industry that consists 
	of mostly non-Indigenous visitors to areas around 
	Cape York. Camping, fishing, four-by-four driving, 
	diving, snorkelling, hiking, geological explorations 
	and observing Indigenous cultural activities. Tourist 
	camping fees are redirected to Traditional Owners. 
	Tensions can arise when tourists don’t observe 
	protocols when on traditional land, such as travelling 
	over sacred and protected areas, or leaving waste and 
	graffiti. In response, Indigenous groups temporarily 
	close down land areas to avoid any inappropriate 
	engagement with the land</div>
