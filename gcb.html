	<H4>Overview</H4>
	<p>The Cape York Peninsula is a true peninsula, 
	extending 800km from the Australian mainland into 
	the Torres Strait, surrounded by water on most of 
	its borders and connected to the mainland at the 
	northeastern coast of Australia, stretching 650km 
	wide. Large, meandering river systems flow west 
	from the peninsula ridge of the Great Dividing Range 
	(large mountain range), into Gulf of Carpentaria, a 
	large shallow sea enclosed on three sides by northern 
	Australia. To the east, short fast flowing rivers (lined 
	with dense rainforests, sand dunes and mangroves) 
	provide freshwater and important nutrients to the 
	biodiverse rich Coral Sea.
	Coral reefs surround the peninsula and are home to 
	a rich diversity of life. Most notably the world’s largest 
	and most extensive coral reef ecosystem, the Great 
	Barrier Reef. It also holds great scientific interest as 
	the habitat of species such as the dugong (“sea cow”) 
	and the large green turtle, which are threatened with 
	extinction. Since 1995 half the corals on the Great 
	Barrier Reef, mostly around Cape York, have died due 
	to climate change induced coral bleaching. 
	The climate of Cape York is tropical and humid, with 
	high average temperatures (27oC-31oC) and high 
	rainfall. The northern tip of the peninsula and coastal 
	areas receives approximately 2,000mm or more of 
	rainfall per year, while the southern inland regions of 
	the peninsula are drier and receive around 700mm or 
	less of rain.</div>

	The monsoon season generally occurs between 
	November and April, bringing to life vast areas of 
	aquatic swamplands and flash flooding. Areas 
	become difficult to navigate and inhabit, as rivers 
	swell and spread across extensive floodplains. The 
	dry season occurs between May and October, where 
	many of the rivers deplete into a series of water holes

	and sand beds. Humidity drops and temperatures rise, 
	increasing the risk of bushfires across the peninsula.
	The Cape York Peninsula supports a complex 
	ecosystem that ranges from tropical rainforests, 
	savannahs and grasslands to coastal vegetation, 
	mangroves and wetlands. National parks that are 
	scattered along the central and eastern regions 
	of the peninsula, protect a significantly biodiverse 
	landscape. 
	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders significantly 
	shaped and transformed the landscape through 
	sustainable land management practices over tens of 
	thousands of years. In contrast, European colonisation 
	caused extensive change by clearing native 
	vegetation and forests, damming rivers, building urban 
	centres and establishing intensive and increasingly 
	industrialised agricultural systems over 250 years. Vast 
	areas of land have also been degraded from pastoral 
	activity and mining, before being handed back to the 
	Traditional Owners.</p>
