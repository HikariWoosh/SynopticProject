    <p>Cape York Peninsula is a large remote peninsula in
	Queensland, northern Australia, and is the location of
	this year’s Engineering for People Design Challenge. It
	is home to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who
	have the longest living continuous cultural history of
	any group of people on Earth, and are the “Traditional
	Owners” or “First Nations” people of Australia.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>This is your opportunity to explore the remote areas of
	the Cape York Peninsula, and learn about this amazing
	culture.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>In Cape York, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are
	spread across over 100 clan groups and numerous
	language groups and dialects. Remoteness and
	large travel distances are common for life on Cape
	York, with many activities revolving around the wet,
	monsoonal season and the dry, bushfire season. The
	region is home to cattle and mining industries, national
	parks and other protected areas of largely unspoiled
	wilderness. The term “Country” is often used to
	describe family origins and associations with particular
	parts of Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
	peoples have cared for land and sea Country as living
	cultural landscapes across thousands of generations.
	National parks and other protected areas play a
	vital role in maintaining and protecting the amazing
	biodiversity and cultural values.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>After the gradual reinstatement of Indigenous land
	rights in the 1970’s, the “homelands movement”
	commenced as people voluntarily returned to live
	back on the land their ancestors occupied prior to
	colonisation. The revolutionary movement back to
	homelands is possible through engineering support,
	enabling the Traditional Owners of the land to live,
	work and thrive on Country, so they can preserve their
	culture</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Homelands and outstations in Queensland and
	Cape York are often old, large pastoral farms, called
	cattle stations, that have been purchased by the
	Australian Government and handed back with the
	land. Homelands are also where cultural heritage and
	knowledge is preserved. Importantly these homelands
	and outstations manage their own essential services.
	They receive very little technical and formal assistance
	from the government and costs for establishing and
	maintaining infrastructure is high. Specialised skills
	needed are hard to find and funding and other support
	is very limited, hard to come by and ad hoc. While
	they are small and few in number, homelands and
	outstations are places of strong cultural significance
	and importance to the Traditional Owners. </p>
	
    <p>Despite the challenges for Aboriginal and Torres
	Strait Islanders returning to their traditional land,
	homelands and outstations are places where people
	can develop meaningful livelihoods, exert traditional
	rights and identity, connect and maintain ancient
	cultural practices and heal. They are important both
	physically and symbolically. They represent places
	that provide access points to Country for a larger clan
	group and this access facilitates the contemporary
	practice of culture combined with the management
	and protection of the land and its rich biodiverse
	ecosystems, an important part of cultural practice.
	Living on Homelands provides for a range of
	improved social and health determinants.</p>

	<p>The local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
	controlled response to COVID-19 has generally
	been viewed as successful, with no deaths and only
	149 cases reported across the whole population,
	as of May 2021. Aboriginal doctors and leaders
	were acutely aware of how vulnerable communities
	would be (due to the lack of healthcare in remote
	areas and Indigenous people having higher risk of
	complications) to the COVID-19 virus, from lessons
	learned of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and
	acted quickly. This included public health messaging,
	flexible grant funding to 110 remote communities
	and the decision to allow local Indigenous controlled
	health agencies to run a culturally aware response. </p>
	</div>
	
	<p>On 18 March 2020, the Government enacted the
	powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 to combat
	the outbreak. This was the first time these powers
	under the Biosecurity Act have been used, preventing
	communities from fishing for food, attending school,
	and leaving to buy essential items like toiletries from
	nearby larger towns. Across Cape York, roadblocks
	were set up preventing access to the remote
	communities. On 12 June 2020, blanket biosecurity
	laws began to lift in place of rules specific to each
	region of Australia. While the decision was widely
	welcomed, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders
	in Cape York raised concerns about the pressure from
	tourism lobby groups to allow travel into vulnerable
	communities, due to the limited resources available to
	respond to an outbreak. Since June 2020 travel within
	Cape York has been open, however some restrictions
	on entering Queensland reamin in place.</p>
