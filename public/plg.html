	<p>The Native Title Act 1993 “recognises the rights 
	and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	people in land and waters according to their 
	traditional laws and customs’’. Native Title allows the 
	right to negotiate certain activities on the land and 
	water and how it is managed, rather than commercial 
	ownership. Each state has additional land acts and 
	tenure regimes that recognise Inidgenous rights to 
	their traditional lands and water, often offering greater 
	rights and control. 
	Prescribed Body Corporates are established for 
	management, representation and decision-making 
	purposes under the Native Title Act, usually reflecting 
	traditional clans, family groupings or decision making 
	structures. Sometimes a council of elders provide 
	guidance in line with traditional decision making 
	protocols.

	The “Cape York Peninsula Aboriginal Land” is 
	unique to Cape York. This land is managed jointly by 
	Traditional Owners and government departments 
	through Indigenous Management Agreements to 
	achieve conservation outcomes. Legislation such 
	as the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 and the Cape York 
	Peninsula Heritage Act 2007, recognises Traditional 
	Owners land rights and began returning the land 
	across Cape York. 
	The Australian government has been purchasing 
	existing pastoral leases (i.e. cattle stations) and 
	negotiating with the Traditional Owners how land can 
	be allocated and managed in line with conservation 
	goals and requirements. The Cape York Tenure 
	Resolution Programme sets out the current state of 
	land tenure and environmental management on the 
	Cape York Peninsula, through Indigenous Land Use 
	Agreements.
	There are multiple Indigenous shire councils across 
	Cape York, one for each discrete community. These 
	councils hold land in the mostly former missions 
	in trust under a “Deed of Grant in Trust” title. These 
	democratically elected councils administer a range of 
	collective services from housing to essential services 
	within the discrete communities themselves but rarely 
	to homelands and outstations.</p>
