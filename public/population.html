    <H3>Population</H3>
	<div>
	<H4>Australia's population is: 25,781,111 people</H4>
	<p>of which</p>
	<H4> An estimated 798,400 are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders</H4>
	<p>but the estimated population in Cape York is</p>
	<H4> Only 9,458 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders </H4>
	</div>
	<div>
	In 1788 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	population was officially estimated to be around 
	770,000. However, this figure is based on limited, 
	unreliable and highly racially biased records and 
	impressions of early colonists, and may have actually 
	been in the millions. 
	Today the Australian government works closely with 
	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities 
	to ensure people can be counted in census data. 
	The 2016 Census of Population and Housing, 
	and National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	Social Survey 2014/15 provides population and 
	demographic data on the Indigenous Regions of the 
	Cape York Peninsula. However, due to the tools and 
	processes associated with data gathering, cultural 
	bias, inaccurate information, regular movement 
	and non-nuclear family structures, the census data 
	can potentially and significantly underestimate the 
	true remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	population figures. 
	</div>
	<div>
	Areas in Australia are classified as “Very remote 
	Australia”, “Remote Australia”, “Outer regional 
	Australia”, “Inner regional Australia” and “Major cities 
	of Australia”. Approximately 30% of Queensland’s 
	total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population 
	were living in major cities, 51% in regional areas, 7% in 
	remote areas and 12% in very remote areas.
	In remote areas, communities are often described 
	in terms of population size and determined by road 
	distance from urban centres, rather than geographical 
	area or the number of dwellings. For example:
	</div>
	<div>
	• Homelands/Outstations - An Indigenous 
	settlement that relies on another community 
	for services. Generally 50 people or fewer and 
	can often consist of one to ten houses. The 
	term homeland and outstation can be used 
	interchangeably. 
	</div>
	<div>
	• Discrete Communities - Large Indigenous 
	communities. Discrete communities are remote, 
	supplied by government utilities and typically 
	operate as service areas for surrounding 
	outstations. A major community is generally 
	around 200 to 1000 people while a minor 
	community is generally fewer than 200 people.</p>
