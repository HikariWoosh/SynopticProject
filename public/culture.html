	<H4>Introduction to  Culture</H4>
	<p>Culture is an umbrella term regarded as the set 
	of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and 
	emotional features of society or a social group. It also 
	encompasses art and literature, lifestyles, ways of 
	living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs. 
	Cultural diversity is embodied in the uniqueness 
	and identities of the groups and societies making 
	up humankind. As a source of exchange, innovation 
	and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for 
	humankind as biodiversity is for nature. Cultural 
	pluralism is the respect for the diversity of people, 
	where minority groups can participate fully in society 
	and maintain their cultural identity. In all we do, we 
	should be enabling inclusion, equity and participation 
	of all citizens, which aids social cohesion, the vitality of 
	civil society and peace. 
	Culture in relation to sustainable development plays 
	an important role not only in promoting, but also 
	enabling sustainable development. Together with 
	economic prosperity, social justice and environmental 
	sustainability, culture is often recognised as the fourth 
	pillar of sustainable development. 
	It may be interesting to note that there is also culture 
	developed within companies and universities, which 
	is why it is so important to value and include various 
	perspectives that widen our understanding and 
	challenge our assumptions, approaches, values 
	and beliefs. This will determine how we act as future 
	professionals within engineering, ensuring we deliver 
	on our responsibility to include cultural diversity in 
	how we approach solution creation</p>

	<H4>Overview</H4>
	<p>Australia has always been multicultural. Before 
	colonisation there were over 250 language groups 
	including over 800 dialects, and many diverse 
	cultures across the continent. Communities were 
	connected through highly organised trading 
	partnerships in complex intertribal and socio-cultural 
	relationships for tens of thousands of years. Aboriginal 
	Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have distinct 
	and diverse cultural histories, and maintain strong 
	connections between each other in Cape York. 
	Spiritual connection and belonging to Country is 
	central to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, 
	creating a deep connection with the land and the 
	sea. It is sustained by a range of human practices, 
	including effective resource use such as traditional 
	fire management. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	peoples don’t generally see themselves as owning or 
	possessing the land but rather as caretakers of the land. 
	As an oral culture (i.e. spoken from one generation 
	to the next), a deep and complex educational 
	system was embedded in the process of passing 
	on knowledge and wisdom through the landscape, 
	through stories, ritual and rites. “Songlines”, that 
	can cross thousands of kilometers of the continent, 
	require maintenance through ritual ceremonies 
	and customary songs between many tribal groups. 
	Complex protocols existed with respect to when, 
	where and to whom knowledge could be shared and 
	passed on.
	Contrary to western cultures views on freedom of 
	information and knowledge systems, Australia’s First 
	Nation communities generally view the passing on of 
	knowledge as a sacred right and something earned 
	through demonstrated wisdom and responsibility.</p>

	<H4>Terminology and Language</H4>
	<p>“Reconciliation” means acknowledging Aboriginal 
	and Torres Strait Islanders as the First People 
	of Australia and recognising the injustices from 
	colonisation. As part of reconciliation, using respectful 
	and inclusive language and terminology is important. 
	Language can impact attitudes, relationships and 
	understandings. The way reconciliation is talked 
	about is just as important as the way people act.
	We encourage you to consider these guidelines 
	and recommendations when exploring the lives and 
	designing for Aboriginal communities.
	Using “Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander” 
	is considered best practice. It should always be 
	capitalised and can be considered offensive to 
	abbreviate i.e. ATSI as this is not inclusive of the 
	diversity of cultures and identities across Australia. 
	“Indigenous Australian people” is also commonly 
	used, especially by non-Aboriginal or non-Torres 
	Strait Islander people, however some people 
	find this offensive, as it can be seen as grouping 
	nations together, and prefer the full name. 
	Pluralised terms such as “First Nations”, “First 
	People” or “Aboriginal People” are acceptable 
	language, and respectfully encompass the 
	diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	cultures and identities. 
	When referring to “non-Indigenous people”, terms 
	such as “non-First Nations” or “other Australians” 
	are also acceptable.
	Avoid using the terms such as “Aborigine”, 
	“disadvantaged”, “native/native Australians” 
	and “lost”, as it is considered offensive as these 
	terms were used historically with derogatory 
	connotations</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<H4>Acknowledgment of Country</H4>
	<p>The concept of Country and the term itself is used 
	widely by Indigneous Australians to describe a deep 
	concept embedded in the notion of life and the land 
	and human connection and interconnection to it, 
	with it and in it. Traditional Country is more than solely 
	ownership, the connection to land or a place on a 
	map. It might mean homeland, tribe, clan, values, 
	stories, resources, cultural sites or ancestral domains. 
	When Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 
	visited the Country of others, there would be rituals 
	of a “Welcome to Country”. As these can only be 
	performed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
	people, an Acknowledgement of Country is an 
	opportunity for anyone to show respect for and 
	continued connection of Traditional Owners to 
	Country, as recognition to the First Australians and 
	custodians of the land</p>
